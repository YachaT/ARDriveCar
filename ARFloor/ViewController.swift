Where the phone is in that position such that the camera is where the user's right hand is, the acceleration is always positive and the y acceleration is reversed; So if the x acceleration is positive then unreverse the  Y acceleration and the steering angle is fixed.

    // this function filters out any acceleration that is not gravitational. More explanation here: Let's say that when the user runs the app and the phone is vertical and this = 1. User the reorients his phone and the accelerometer updates us on the new acceleration du to gravity acceleration, which could be something like 0.9. However, we need to filter out the 0.9 value from any accelerations that are not gravitational and we do that by putting our previous acceleration value which was "accelerationValues[1]", our updatedacceleration value which is 0.9; we would put both of these accelerations into our function and through a complex equation it would return a filtered acceleration due to gravity that better reflects the orientation of the phone.
